# Express Notes

## Introduction
This project is a result of our bootcamp's week 11 homework assignment. Students were expected to create a note-taking app after implementing our own CRUD routes. The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/graycodesnu/express-notes) and the deployed link can be found [here](https://heroku-express-notes.herokuapp.com/).

## Goals 
The goal of this assignment was to create a note-taking app meeting the below criteria:

+ A user is presented with a page of existing notes listed in the lefthand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and note content in the righthand column
+ A user may save their note and it will append to the lefthand column containing the saved notes
+ A user may select a saved note and the title and content of the saved note will appear in the righthand column 

## Results 
Overall I found this assignment enjoyable and I was able to leverage many of Week 11's activities in order to complete the functionality needed. I did attempt to complete the bonus DELETE function, but I wasn't able to get it sorted. I believe this had to do with a disconnect between the note's ID and the way I was invoking it.
